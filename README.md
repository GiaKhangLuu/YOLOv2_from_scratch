Implementing YOLOv2 by Pytorch. The next version of this [repo](https://github.com/GiaKhangLuu/YOLOv1_from_scratch). This YOLOv2 trained on the same dataset as the previous version.

This repository helps us know how to implement anchor boxes, which is one of the most important concepts introduced in YOLOV2.

Check out the `train.ipynb` to see the result. Due to the limitation of time, I trained and evaluated just one image to ensure my model worked correctly.
