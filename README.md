Implementing YOLOv2 by Pytorch. The next version of this [repo](https://github.com/GiaKhangLuu/YOLOv1_from_scratch). This YOLOv2 train on the same dataset of the previous version.

Check out the `train.ipynb` to see the result. Due to the limitation of time, I just train and evaluate on just one image to ensure my model works correctly.
